# Classifying_Human_Cell_Record_Using_SVM-L
Objectives After completing this lab you will be able to:

Use scikit-learn to Support Vector Machine to classify In this notebook, you will use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.

SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong.
